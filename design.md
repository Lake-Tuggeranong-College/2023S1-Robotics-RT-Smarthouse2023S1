Smart Home Automation System:

This smart home automation system can monitor and control various aspects of a home environment. It incorporates multiple inputs and outputs for enhanced functionality and user experience.

## Behaviours

Lighting Control:

The potentiometer can adjust the overall brightness of the lights in the home. Rotating the potentiometer can dim or brighten the lights accordingly, providing customizable lighting levels.

Security System:
The crash sensor, line sensor, and PIR sensor can collectively form a comprehensive security system.
If the crash sensor is pressed it causes a house lockdown which locks all doors and releases security screens over the windows. This is represented by the dc motor being activated.
The line sensor can be used to create virtual boundaries or detect unauthorized movement in key areas such as the front doorway. If triggered, it can activate the LEDs and buzzers to alert the occupants.
The PIR sensor detects human presence and can be used to activate the security system when no one is expected to be present. It triggers the LEDs and buzzers to notify the occupants.

Proximity Detection:
The sonar sensor can be employed to detect the distance to objects or obstacles in the environment.
If an object is detected within a specified range, it can activate the servo motor to adjust the position of a surveillance camera or an automated door to avoid collisions or obstruction.

Data Logging and Analysis:
The SD card can be utilized for logging data related to various sensors in the system.
Sensor readings, timestamps, and any relevant information can be stored on the SD card for future analysis, system optimization, or security purposes.

This integrated smart home automation system provides enhanced security, convenience, and energy management capabilities by leveraging the inputs from various sensors and controlling the outputs accordingly.
