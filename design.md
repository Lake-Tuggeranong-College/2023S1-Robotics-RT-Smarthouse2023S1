## Smart Device Theme


The smart chess timer will act like a normal chess timer with an adjustable countdown timer for each player and an input which changes what timer is decreasing. I will implement the smart aspect of the timer by using the button to switch the timer whenever it detects motion. When one of the timers reach the end the servo will turn on to alert the players that they have run out of time. There might be functionality that allows the timer to increase by a small increment every time it switches allowing for more gameplay options. You can use the sd card to store the results of who won and who lost the game. You could use the RFID sensor with your own card so you can sign into your account to track the games.
